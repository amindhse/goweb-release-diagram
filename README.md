Markwhen is an interactive text-to-timeline tool. Write markdown-ish text and it gets converted into a nice looking cascading timeline.

Use the editor [here](https://markwhen.com).

This repo is for the _renderer_, not the editor. The editor (markwhen.com) and [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Markwhen.markwhen) are built on top of the renderer.

## Quick start

```
> git clone git@github.com:mark-when/markwhen.git
> cd markwhen
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

The renderer renders whatever is given to the [`markwhenStore`](src/Markwhen/markwhenStore.ts).

To enable editing from the timeline view, set [`editorOrchestrator.editable`](src/EditorOrchestrator/editorOrchestratorStore.ts) to `true`:

```
const editable = ref(true);
```
